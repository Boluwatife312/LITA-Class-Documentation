During the process of this project, I focused on two main areas;
1. Sales Performance Analysis for a retail store
2. Customer Segmentation for a subscription based service

The goal was go deeper into each data set to find insights on sales trend, customers behavior and regional performance. To achieve this,i used SQL,EXCEL and Power BI to analyze my data and visualize the findings.

  - For Data Cleaning
  - For Data Analysis
  - For Data Visualization
  
- SQL Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### *Data Cleaning and Preparations*
----------------

In the Initial phase of the Data Cleaning and preparation,we perform the following action;
1. Data Loading and Inspection
